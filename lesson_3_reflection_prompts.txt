When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I can see many reasons. One is the chance to collaborate with other developers 
    and work together on the same project. Another reason is that a remote repository 
    is a good backup option.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because I can work locally, with temporary branches, for example, and just
    update github when I am sure that my changes are really necessary.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork is a copy of a repository on GitHub. It must be used to make changes to a repository 
    and we don't have access to the original repository.

    A clone is copy of a repository. It is possible to clone a local or a remote repository (on GitHub). 
    Use this for collaborating.

    Branches are labels to commits that will create leafs on the master branch, creating a track for updating 
    informations without changing the master branch. 
    Use this for creating new features/bug fixes.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It is possible to compare things offline.
